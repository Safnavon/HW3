notes and questions:
-can we use CJump with only boolean value?
 create "eval" function on AST_EXP(interface and impl) that evaluates that expression's
 boolean value (to use in "while" and "if" T_Cjump node).
 meaning our CJump implementation should also be changed (always check if value in input T_MEM is > 0 and go to relevant label)
