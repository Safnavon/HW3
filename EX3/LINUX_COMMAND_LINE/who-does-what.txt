notes and questions:
-can we use CJump with only boolean value?
 create "eval" function on AST_EXP(interface and impl) that evaluates that expression's
 boolean value (to use in "while" and "if" T_Cjump node).
 meaning our CJump implementation should also be changed (always check if value in input T_MEM is > 0 and go to relevant label)
-DROR:
    CJump is not a real mips command
    we have beq (branch equals), bne (branch not equals) and j (jump) [there are more: http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/Mips/jump.html ]
    we can do something like this:
    translating this ic:
        if(foo())
            x = 1;
        else
            x = 2;
        y = 1
    into mips:
            sw Temp_222, RESULT OF foo()
            bne Temp_222, $zero, Label_else#56
            // x = 1;
            j Label_endif#56
        Label_else#56:
            // x = 2;
            j Label_endif#56
        Label_endif#56:
            // y = 1
